This repository contains generated parsers.

- CLexer.java: This file is the Lexer generated by ANTLR based on your grammar file. The Lexer's job is to read the input text and convert it into a stream of tokens. Each token represents a meaningful chunk of text, such as a word, identifier, keyword, or symbol.

- CParser.java: This file is the Parser generated by ANTLR based on your grammar file. The Parser's job is to take the stream of tokens produced by the Lexer and arrange them into a parse tree according to the rules of the grammar.

- CBaseListener.java and CListener.java: These files are related to the Listener pattern, which is one way to traverse the parse tree created by the parser. CListener.java is an interface defining methods for entering and exiting each node in the parse tree, while CBaseListener.java is an empty implementation of this interface. You can extend CBaseListener.java to create your own Listener class that does something useful as it traverses the parse tree.

- CBaseVisitor.java and CVisitor.java: These files are related to the Visitor pattern, which is another way to traverse the parse tree. Like the Listener files, CVisitor.java is an interface and CBaseVisitor.java is an empty implementation of this interface. You can extend CBaseVisitor.java to create your own Visitor class that processes the parse tree in some way.
